USAGE
    java -jar MCDeploy.jar [help | deploy | update | describe CONFIG_PATHS... | new DIRECTORY]

COMMANDS
    help:
        Display this screen.
    new:
        Create the template project in DIRECTORY. The directory must either not exist or be empty.
    deploy:
        Deploy the configuration specified in ./mcdeploy.toml
    update:
        Update the deployed server in the current directory according to the configuration in ./mcdeploy.toml
        The main difference between this and the 'deploy' command is that this command overwrites files,
        and warns the user before doing so.
    describe:
        Print help for each of CONFIG_PATHS passed. A Config Path is a dot (.) or slash (/) delimited string,
        describing a specific section in the config file. For example,
        to reference the [Server.JarSource] section you would use one of these Config Paths: 'Server.JarSource' 'Server/JarSource'

CONFIG
    To get info about the config, run this program with the following arguments:
        MCDeploy describe Environment Properties Server Datapacks
    If you are not sure about a config section / value, try to look it up using 'MCDeploy describe'.
    The sections are:
        [Server]
        [Environment]
        [Datapacks]
        [Plugins]
        [Properties]

RETURN VALUE
    0 - Success
    1 - User error
    2 - Server error
    3 - Hash mismatch
    Other - Java / Kotlin error, please submit bug report
