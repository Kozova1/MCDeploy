Fetcher
Fetcher: String, any of "LauncherManifest", "DownloadURL", "CopyFile"

Decides which Fetcher will be used for the server.
Only one Fetcher can be enabled at a time - trying to enable multiple ones at the same time will cause errors!
The different Fetchers are explained in @Server.JarSource
The fetcher's configuration is to be merged with the @Server.JarSource value, like this:

    [Server.JarSource]
    Fetcher = "LauncherManifest"
    Version = "1.6.4" # This is the LauncherManifest.Version parameter

LauncherManifest Options:
Fetcher: String - Must be "LauncherManifest"
Version: String - Which version of the server to download.
                  Can be either a version, or the special values "latest-release" or "latest-snapshot".
                  By default it is set to "latest-release"
LauncherManifestURL: URL - URL to the launcher manifest.
                           DO NOT CHANGE THIS UNLESS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY SURE ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING!


DownloadURL Options:
Fetcher: String - Must be "DownloadURL"
ServerJarURL: URL - Where to download server.jar from.
Sha1Sum: String - SHA-1 sum of the server.jar, used to validate the download.

CopyFile Options:
Fetcher: String - Must be "CopyFile"
CopyFrom: File - Path to server.jar to use as this server's server.jar
