This section configures where the server.jar will be sourced from.
It uses Fetchers, which are different modules that obtain server.jar in different ways.
If you only wish to host a vanilla server, without using any modifications to the server.jar itself,
you probably want to use LauncherManifest as your Fetcher.

There are 3 available Fetchers:
LauncherManifest - Uses the official Minecraft server.jar. See @Server.JarSource.Fetcher
DownloadURL - Downloads a file from the internet as a server.jar, and verifies it. See @Server.JarSource.Fetcher
CopyFile - Copies server.jar from another location on your computer. See @Server.JarSource.Fetcher
